TkUtil-Gui

Basically allows naming widgets, auto-specification of variable
references in GUI, and recovery of state of GUI with a single
call.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

To see this module in use, run

    perl eg/Gui.t

Examine the code, and use the GUI, then hit button ("Show")
at bottom of the screen. Change GUI again, hit "Show" and notice
change in output. This makes it real easy to interrogate a GUI
for final content before doing anything with it. You can check
for valid, consistent input, tell the user if something is
wrong, and pass information on in a nice, organized fashion
to another program, if that's appropriate.
